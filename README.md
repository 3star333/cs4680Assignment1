This project compares the performance of **Linear Regression** and **Degree 2 Polynomial Regression** models for predicting insurance costs based on patient demographics and health factors.

The findings show that degree 2 polynomial regression performs best at predicting insurance costs based on patient demographics and health factors.
Models for linear regression and polynomial regression were trained on the same dataseet, scaled accordingly. Comparison was made using user-generated data.
More extensive testing may reveal differences in model effectiveness based on size and variance of future data.
